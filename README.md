# Amos UI

Thoughts:
My intentions for this project are unknown. I just felt the need to extract and update the old 'void' project that I had. I want this to be an easy way to build interfaces for side projects.
For example, game editors. This aims to be a solution for those quick things I want to develop.
Now, the cards might not be always needed. So, the individual components could be used outside of cards.

Ideas:
* Icons
* Spacing component
* Checkboxes
* Radio Buttons
* Number
* Color picker
* Select / Dropdown

* Minimal CSS - Rigid predefined layout/grid system
* Snap back to original position
* Snap to possible places
* Graphs - fast numbers?
* Desktop / Tablet Centric
